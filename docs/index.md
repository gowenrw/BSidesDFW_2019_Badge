# AKIRA Badge

Welcome to the AKIRA Badge website.

Home to all the information related to the BSidesDFW 2019 AKIRA Badge.  
This includes code and art and cad and fab files.  All the things.

This is also where you will find resources and examples for working with the CH552G micro-controller that is at the heart of this badge.

Please allow me to be your guide.

# Badge Details

## CH552G Micro-Controller

The CH552G is the inexpensive micro-controller that is at the heart of this badge.
It has been highlighted on Hackaday and elsewhere as a great option for hardware projects.
However, when designing this badge we found there were limited resources available online for this chip as opposed to other more popular and expensive chips.
So, hopefully this repository can help future users of this great micro-controller.


## Crypto Challenge

The AKIRA Badge includes a cryptography challenge that will not be detailed here until after the conference is over and the winner is announced.
Be assured that the firmware code and other files included here will not provide any hints to solving this challenge.
