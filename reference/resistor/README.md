## Reference Files

Note that we were looking for two different resistor applications.
The first needed to be 10k Ohm for use as a pull up resistor to put the IC into programming mode.
The second considered several different resistance values for best use with the LED's being considered.

### Pull up resistors

* Walsin Tech Corp WR12X103 JTL 1206 10K Ohm 1/4 Watt Resistor
  * Tested and CHOSEN for the badge as it's form factor and Watt rating is perfect for the badge
  * [LCSC.COM Reference](./1904031205_Walsin-Tech-Corp-10KR-103-5_C384031_1206_10kohm_025W_lcsc.com.pdf)
  * [Datasheet](./1904031205_Walsin-Tech-Corp-10KR-103-5_C384031_1206_10kohm_025W_datasheet.pdf)
* Vishay Intertech CRCW120610K0FKEA 1206 10K Ohm 3/4 Watt Resistor
  * Tested and NOT chosen as it's larger size due to an unneeded larger Wattage was not a good fit
  * [LCSC.COM Reference](./Vishay-Intertech-CRCW120610K0FKEA_C242483_1206_10kohm_075W_lcsc.com.pdf)

* Uniroyal Elec 0805W8F1002T5E 0805 10K Ohm 1/8 Watt Resistor
  * Tested and NOT chosen as it's smaller form factor was not a good fit
  * [LCSC.COM Reference](./Uniroyal-Elec-0805W8F1002T5E_C17414_0805_10kohm_0125W_lcsc.com.pdf)

### LED resistors

* Walsin Tech Corp WR12X331 JTL 1206 330 Ohm 1/4 Watt Resistor
  * Tested and CHOSEN for the badge as it's form factor and resistance is perfect for the badge
  * [LCSC.COM Reference](./1904031131_Walsin-Tech-Corp-330R-331-5_C383978_1206_330ohm_lcsc.com.pdf)
  * [Datasheet](./1904031131_Walsin-Tech-Corp-330R-331-5_C383978_1206_330ohm_datasheet.pdf)
* Walsin Tech Corp WR12X221 JTL 1206 220 Ohm 1/4 Watt Resistor
  * Tested and NOT chosen as it's smaller resistance had the LEDs a bit too bright for the badge
  * [LCSC.COM Reference](./1904031110_Walsin-Tech-Corp-220R-221-5_C383998_1206_220ohm_lcsc.com.pdf)
